# ☀️ Solar Calendar

A reimagined calendar system that aligns each year with the **Spring Equinox**, maintains perfect 4-week months, and introduces **Equinox Day** and **Solstice Day** to stay synced with Earth's orbit.

This project displays a full **Gregorian calendar** (starting with 2025), overlaying each day with its corresponding **Solar Calendar** date.
