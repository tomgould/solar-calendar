# ☀️ Solar Calendar

The Solar Calendar is a fresh, easy-to-follow calendar system that stays naturally in sync with the Earth's orbit around the sun.

Instead of uneven months, it gives us **13 months of 28 days** — each with exactly 4 full weeks. The year always begins with the **Spring Equinox** (when day and night are equal), and it uses two special days to stay perfectly aligned:

- **Equinox Day** — the real astronomical start of the year
- **Solstice Day** — a leap correction day added after August during leap years

🌍 Best of all: this system makes **daylight savings time unnecessary**. The calendar flows with nature, not against it.

This project shows:

- A full **Solar Calendar** (starting with 2025) with each day matched to the standard Gregorian date
- A full **Gregorian Calendar** with each day mapped to its Solar Calendar equivalent

It's an experiment in **re-thinking how we measure time** — to make it simpler, fairer, and more human.
