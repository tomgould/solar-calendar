# ☀️ Solar Calendar

A reimagined calendar system that aligns each year with the **Spring Equinox**, maintains perfect 4-week months, and introduces **Equinox Day** and **Solstice Day** to stay synced with Earth's orbit.

This project displays a 13 month **Solar Calendar** (starting with 2025), overlaying each day with its corresponding **Gregorian Calendar** date.

There is also a full **Gregorian calendar** (starting with 2025), overlaying each day with its corresponding **Solar Calendar** date.

This project merges the **Gregorian calendar** years with the **Solar calendar** dates.

You can view the calenders here:
